What we need to send to RPi:
Movement value: A D W
e.g.:
MOVEMENT;W
MOVEMENT;WWWAWW

PLOT;coordinates of obstacles
e.g.:
PLOT;4,5;5,5;6,5

What we need to receive from RPi:
START signal for exploration
FASTEST signal for fastest path, with coordinate of waypoint
e.g.: FASTEST;4,7


Element[0] is the command (PLOT, FASTEST, etc)
Semicolon for splitting
